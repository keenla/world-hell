Idea of letting Internet Service Providers to manage financial support for creators of intellectual content (webpage/site creation/managing; audio, video, news, blogs, art, …), giving them chance to provide alternative page  version of clean adfree conten and helping them compensate service costs.

Reasons: as we all know, irrelevant ads are annoying, but sadly most easiest way to compensate costs; 
people are lazy - registering on countless sites and going through/setting up banking transfers for each is time consuming(or more commonly: preferring to visit sites just as paying guest), and increases risks for spam postings;
very often messages "please help us by donation" are dismissed only because its too lengthy(!!) to click through the donation payment chain for small transfer.

How it could look like in real life: 
browsing in "ad supported or adfree mode" in Chrome/Firefox/…; or maximum two mouse clicks
links with price tag (example : 0.01(maybe?) cents per page view for Wikipedia or online forums/blogs/… just to show support, (there's possible misuse: creation of more "dilute" pages);
0.01…1$ per daily news articles without registering as client; 
"tip box" - leave a cent or ten for videos on Youtube(and similar) as a message: "Keep up good work!"
