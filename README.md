Idea of letting Internet Service Providers to manage financial support transfer from users to creators of intellectual content (web page/site creation/managing; audio, video, news, blogs, art, …), giving creators a chance to provide alternative page  version of clean ad free content and helping them compensate service costs.

Reasons: as we all know, irrelevant ads are annoying, but sadly most easiest way to compensate costs; 
people are lazy - registering on countless sites and going through/setting up banking transfers for each is time consuming(or more commonly: preferring to visit sites just as guest), and increases risks for spam postings;
very often messages "please help us by donation" are dismissed only because its too lengthy(!!) to click through the donation payment chain for tiny transfer.

How it could look like in real life: 
browsing in "ad supported or adfree mode" in Chrome/Firefox/…; (adfree= micropayment transfer, not adblock)
links with price tag (example : 0.01(maybe?) cents per page view for Wikipedia or online forums/blogs/… just to show support, (there's possible misuse: creation of more "dilute" pages);
0.01…1$ per daily news articles without registering as client; …1$…10$… per downloads of programs or music albums or streaming HQ movies or other digital arts
"tip box" - leave a cent or ten for videos on Youtube(and similar) as a message: "Keep up good work!" with no more than 2…3 mouse clicks.
Main goal is small-payment method, that allows transfer things to be completed within seconds, and to give even the most cheapest stuff to create some profit.
